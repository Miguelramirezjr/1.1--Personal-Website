# 1.1--Personal-Website
First project given to us at The Iron Yard. I used nothing but HTML and CSS to create this web page.


# Create a portfolio with basic HTML and CSS

## Description
Your portfolio will be the initial and primary way that many employers or
clients judge your skills as a frontend developer. Eventually it will showcase
your projects, but initially we want it to serve as a place to share your
contact information.
